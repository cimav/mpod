	  <h3>MPOD Introduction</h3>
	  <br/>
	  The Material Properties Open Database (MPOD) was initiated by Daniel Chateigner in July 2010.
	  <br/><br/>
	  The MPOD was inspired by the <a href="http://www.crystallography.net/">Crystallography Open Database</a> (COD).
	  <br/><br/>
	  Crystallographic structures affect microscopic properties of the phases constituting a given material which has consequences at the macroscopic scale. Knowledge about the structure can also be used to make predictions about such properties, e.g. with a simulation approach (DFT, Molecular dynamics, …). 
	  <br/><br/>
	  Knowledge about experimentally measured crystallite properties, however, is of key importance for counter-checking theoretical studies and also to better define fitting models for the structure determination itself.
	  <br/><br/>
	  MPOD tries to comply with the Crystallographic Information Files (CIF) format in use by the International Union of Crystallography (<a href="http://www.iucr.org/">IUCR</a>).
